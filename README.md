JBehavePoC
==========

Description
-----------
This is a proof of concept of JBehave, just to study this library and the BDD concepts in Java.

Libraries used
--------------

This project uses Maven to download its libraries and their dependencies. They are:

* junit, because we have tests!
* jbehave, obviously
* jbehave-junit-runner, so we can have a nice output when running our tests in Eclipse
