JBehavePoC
==========

Description
-----------
This is a proof of concept of JBehave, just to study this library and the BDD concepts in Java.

Libraries used
--------------

This project uses Maven to download its libraries and their dependencies. They are:

* *junit*, because we have tests!
* *jbehave*, obviously
* *jbehave-junit-runner*, so we can have a nice output when running our tests in Eclipse

"Why Maven?"
------------

Because I already know how to use Maven.

I hope I can move this project to gradle in a near future, so @marceloemanoel won't kill me.
